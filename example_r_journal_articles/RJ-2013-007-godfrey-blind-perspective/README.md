This article:

* was written in plain LaTeX
* has code snippets (static)
* uses `\citep{}` and `\citet{}` with references in a BibTeX file
* uses footnotes
* has _no_ figures
* has _no_ equations
* has some custom LaTeX commands, defined directly in the `.tex` file

## Build instructions

### PDF

This folder is self-contained so that the PDF can be built by calling:

```sh
$ Rscript -e "tools:::texi2pdf('RJwrapper.tex')"
```

The generated PDF will be named RJwrapper.pdf.

### HTML

A simple HTML pre-print was created by the author using TeX4HT which is part of many LaTeX distributions, or can be added as the tex4ht package. 

The Windows batch file contained the commands

```
latex RJwrapper
bibtex RJwrapper
latex RJwrapper
htlatex RJwrapper

del SubmissionGodfrey.css
del SubmissionGodfrey.html
ren RJwrapper.css SubmissionGodfrey.css
ren RJwrapper.html SubmissionGodfrey.html

del RJwrapper.out
del RJwrapper.aux
del RJwrapper.blg
del RJwrapper.bbl
del RJwrapper.lg
del RJwrapper.xref
del RJwrapper.4tc
del RJwrapper.4ct
del RJwrapper.tmp
del RJwrapper.idv
del RJwrapper.ent
del RJwrapper.dvi
```

This creates a copy of the generated CSS and HTML files with a more meaningful name and deletes 
the many auxiliary files generated by `htlatex` in converting the `.tex` file to HTML.

The result can be seen here: https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/papers/rjournal.v5.n1/ 
(a small amount of additional HTML was manually added at the top to show it is a pre-print).
